# Face Detection Project
This project focuses on face detection using computer vision techniques and a YOLO-based deep learning model.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect human faces in images accurately and efficiently. A pre-trained YOLO model was used and fine-tuned on a face dataset to improve detection performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- Computer Vision

## Results
The trained model achieved good performance in detecting faces, with an accuracy of approximately **81%** based on evaluation metrics.

## Note
The notebook is provided for demonstration and code review purposes.  
The full model training was not re-run to save time and computational resources.
